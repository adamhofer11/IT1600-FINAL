# Advanced Tips

Now that you've learned the basics, here are some tips and advanced tricks to make your work with Git and GitHub more efficient.

### Tip 1: Use Branches for Feature Development
When working on new features or fixes, create a new branch to keep your work separate from the main code:
```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
```
Once you're done, switch back to the main branch and merge your changes:
```bash
git checkout master
git merge new-feature
```

### Tip 2: Resolve Merge Conflicts
If two people make changes to the same line of a file, a merge conflict may occur. Git will notify you of this conflict. Open the file and look for the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`). Resolve the conflict and commit the file.

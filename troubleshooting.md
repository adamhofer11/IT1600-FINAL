# Troubleshooting

Sometimes things don't work as expected. Here are some common issues users might face, along with their solutions.

### Issue 1: "fatal: not a git repository"
**Solution:**
Make sure youâ€™re in the correct directory where your Git repository was initialized. If you are not, navigate to that directory using the `cd` command.

### Issue 2: "Permission Denied" when Pushing Changes
**Solution:**
This usually happens when Git is unable to authenticate you with GitHub. Ensure that your SSH key is set up correctly or that you are using the correct HTTPS credentials.
